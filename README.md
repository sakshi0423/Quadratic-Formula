# Quadratic-Formula
In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form: <br>
> <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + c = 0

Graphing, we get the curve below:

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

Write a C++ program called `quadratic.cpp` that solves the quadratic equation for the xâ€˜s :
